It is constructed like this: <img src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/7659/anatomy-of-an-html-element.png' height='' width='400'><br><p>The start tag is used to define the type of HTML element you want to render in the webpage. So inputing h1 into the opening tag will render a large heading on the webpage.<br><h5>Task:<h5><h6>Following the structure displayed above, create a HTML element with h1 in the start tag, Please enter your name!, Remember the End Tag</li></h6></li><br> Within each tag is were content which will be displayed on the webpage is input. <br>However when creating HTML elements you must remember to the closing tag! If you forget to input the closing tag then following HTML elements will be effected. <br> Using the Text Editor, Try for yourself, Remove the closing tag from the HTML element you created. Now create a second HTML element underneath. In the opening and closing tags replace h1 with p and input your name between both tags. Now, run the code to see the effect! <br><br>As you can see the p element is effected by the unclosed tag. Using p in the start tag should render normal text.<br> <br><h5>Task:</h5><h6>Add the Closing Tag to the h1 element, and run the code again!</h6><br><p> In the next lesson, we will continue with HTML elements, and opening and closing tags!</p><br>><br> "	,
