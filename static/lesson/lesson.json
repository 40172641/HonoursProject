HTML elements are individual components of web pages which act as the basic building blocks of HTML.</h6><br> <br> <h6>HTML Elements:</h6> HTML elements are constructed using  a opening tag, and ending tag, and content between the two tags. Here is an example of how HTML elements are constructed alongside an example of a constructed HTML element below: <br><br><img src='https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-web-design/9781449337513/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2257977.png' height='' width='420'><br><p>HTML elements are defined by the value of the opening tag. So entering h1 as the value of the opening tag will display large heading content. While entering p, will display standard paragraph content.<br><h5>Task:<h5><h6>The text editor adjacent to this matieral allows you to enter HTML and have it rendered on screen in the third column! Following the structure displayed above: <ul><li> Create a HTML element using h1 as the value in the opening tag, Please enter your name as the content between the opening and closing tag, then run the code!</li></ul></h6></li>In order to display content on web pages, the content must be placed between the opening and closing tag of the HTML element. <br> <p>However, when creating HTML elements you must remember the closing tag of the HTML element! If you forget to the closing tag of one HTML element, then following elements may render the same value as the unclosed HTML element. <br> Using the Text Editor, Try this for yourself, Remove the closing tag from the HTML element you created. Now create a second HTML element underneath. The value of the opening and closing tags should be p! Between the tags please enter your name again! Now, run the code to see how it affects the web page! <br><br>As you can see the second HTML element renders the same value as the first HTML element because of the unclosed tag.<br> <br><h5>Task:</h5><h6><ul><li>Add the Closing Tag to the first element you created, and run the code again to check the output!</li></ul></h6><br><p> In the next lesson, we will continue with HTML elements, and how they fit into the overall structure of HTML documents and web pages.</p><br><br><br><br> "	,
